What's a blog without dark mode? My [prior blog home](https://gojimmypi.blogspot.com/) had _only_ dark mode. 
I was inspired by [Aleksandr's blog](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/) with a clever little lamp that toggles
between light and dark mode.

Hopefully for others, he will [write a blog](https://github.com/AleksandrHovhannisyan/aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/issues/72)
on this topic. I ended up spending the time to reverse engineer it and apply to this fork of gridster theme.


It is probably a good idea to not hardcode color values, as mentioned in [Derek Kedziora's Dark Mode Revisited](https://derekkedziora.com/blog/dark-mode-revisited).
The default [Jekyll Gridster theme](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/gridster-jekyll-theme) I am using has a bunch of hardcoded values, so that's another thing to fix.

The key is the JavaScript `toggle` method that removes a class if already present, otherwises adds the class:

``` css

document.body.classList.toggle("dark-theme", forceDarkMode)

```

see `_includes/_dark_mode.js` typically found in the `_includes/footer.html`.

The `_sass/partials/components/_lamp.css` contains the classes for all dark mode toggles:

{% include code_header.html %}
``` css
head.dark-theme,
article.dark-theme,
.sidebar.dark-theme,
code.dark-theme,
body.dark-theme {
    color: #eee;
    background: #121212;

    a {
        color: antiquewhite;
    }

    a:hover {
        color: white;
        text-decoration-color: white;
        text-decoration: underline;
    }
}
```

Code snippet syntax highlighting is implemented with [rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/) and is installed with:
```
gem install rouge
```

To toggle dark-mode, the `rougify style base16.dark > github.dark.css` command was used 
(there does not seem to yet be a `github.dark` implemented). The resultant file had all the
`.highlight ` text segments removed, then was all placed within the `code.dark-theme` 
in the [_lamp.scss](https://github.com/gojimmypi/gridster-jekyll-theme/blob/gh-pages/_sass/partials/components/_lamp.scss) file.
